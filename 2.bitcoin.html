  <strong><p>Bitcoin(₿) is a cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

  <p>
  It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single
  administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer
  bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:50px;">Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded
  in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by
  an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and
  was released as open-source software in 2009.</p>
  <p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining.
  They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.
  Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017,
  there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet,
  most of them using bitcoin.</p>
